<p>Summit has identified Four Elements of College Readiness that are part of everything we do: </p>

<h2>Cognitive Skills</h2>

<h2>Content Knowledge</h2>

<h2>Habits of Success</h2>

<h2>Real-world Experiences</h2>

<hr />

<p>To equip themselves with enduring skills for success in college and life, Summit students:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Work collaboratively on rich, project-based experiences to deepen their critical thinking, problem-solving and communication skills, as well as apply what they're learning in real-life situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn subject-specific material at their own pace and using the style in which they learn best, with individual support and coaching from teachers as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Meet weekly with a mentor (a teacher) who serves as their coach and advocate, and supports them as they work towards achieving their goals and aspirations.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Supporting the Summit experience is the Personalized Learning Plan (PLP). The PLP is an online, dynamic platform that allows students to set goals, track their progress on these goals and access all of their learning resources. Putting the power of learning in their hands, students are able to see how their daily actions all contribute to getting them from where they are to where they want to be.</p>

<p>Thanks to ongoing support from a handful of engineers at Facebook, weâ€™ve been able to dramatically improve the PLP and schools participating in Basecamp will now be able to customize it for their specific needs.</p>
